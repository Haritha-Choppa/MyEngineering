geology; Weathering, erosion and denudations process on earth material and natural agencies, Geological
work of wind, river underground water and glaciers. Types of weathering, its effect over the properties of
rocks, Brief study of case histories of failure of some Civil Engineering constructions due to geological
draw backs</p>

Geological Considerations in the selection of a dam site. Geological factors influencing water Lightness
and life of reservoirs – Purposes of tunneling, Effects of Tunneling on the ground, Role of Geological
Considerations (i.e. Lithological, structural and ground water) in tunneling over break and lining in
tunnels. Improvement of competence of sites by grouting etc</p>
