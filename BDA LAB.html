      <h2>List of Experiments</h2>

<h4>Experiment 1: Week 1, 2:</h4>
<p>1. Implement the following Data structures in Java</p>
<p>a) Linked Lists</p>
<p> b) Stacks </p>
<p>c) Queues </p>
<p>d) Set </p>
<p>e) Map</p>
<h4>Experiment 2: Week 3:</h4>
<p>2. (i)Perform setting up and Installing Hadoop in its three operating modes: </p>
 <p>Standalone, Pseudo distributed, Fully distributed </p>
 <p>(ii)Use web based tools to monitor your Hadoop setup.</p>
<h4>Experiment 3: Week 4:</h4>
<p>3.Implement the following file management tasks in Hadoop:</p>
<p>• Adding files and directories </p>
<p>• Retrieving files </p>
<p>• Deleting files</p>
<p>Hint: A typical Hadoop workflow creates data files (such as log files) elsewhere and copies 
them into HDFS using one of the above command line utilities.</p>
<h4>Experiment 4: Week 5:</h4>
<p>4. Run a basic Word Count Map Reduce program to understand Map Reduce Paradigm.</p>
<h4>Experiment 5: Week 6:</h4>
<p>5. Write a map reduce program that mines weather data.</p>
<p>Weather sensors collecting data every hour at many locations across the globe gather </p>
<p>a large volume of log data, which is a good candidate for analysis with Map Reduce, 
since it is semi structured and record-oriented.</p>
<h4>Experiment 6: Week 7:</h4>
<p>6.Use Map Reduce to find the shortest path between two people in a 
7.social graph.</p>
<p>Hint: Use an adjacency list to model a graph, and for each node store the distance from the 
original node, as well as a back pointer to the original node. Use the mappers to propagate the 
distance to the original node, and the reducer to restore the state of the graph. Iterate until the 
target node has been reached.</p>
<h4>Experiment 7: Week 8:</h4>
<p>8. Implement Friends-of-friends algorithm in Map Reduce.</h4>
<p>Hint: Two Map Reduce jobs are required to calculate the FoFs for each user in a social 
network .The first job calculates the common friends for each user, and the second job sorts 
the common friends by the number of connections to your friends.</p>
<h4>Experiment 8: Week 9:</h4>
<p>9. Implement an iterative PageRank graph algorithm in Map Reduce.</p> 
<p>Hint: PageRank can be implemented by iterating a Map Reduce job until the graph has 
converged. The mappers are responsible for propagating node PageRank values to their</p>
<h4>Experiment 9: Week 10:</h4>
<p>10. Perform an efficient semi-join in Map Reduce.</p>
<p>Hint: Perform a semi-join by having the mappers load a Bloom filter from the 
Distributed Cache, and then filter results from the actual Map Reduce data source by 
performing membership queries against the Bloom filter to determine which data 
source records should be emitted to the reducers.</p>
<h4>Experiment 10: Week 11:</h4>
<p>11. Install and Run Pig then write Pig Latin scripts to sort, group, join, project, 
and filter your data.</p>
<h4>Experiment 12: Week 12:</h4>
<p>12. Install and Run Hive then use Hive to create, alter, and drop databases, tables, 
views, functions, and indexes</p>
